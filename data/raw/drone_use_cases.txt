Use Case: Agriculture
Drones are widely used in Indian agriculture for crop monitoring, pesticide spraying,
fertilizer distribution, and soil health analysis. They help farmers identify crop stress,
optimize resource usage, and reduce manual labor.
Example:
Indian companies such as Garuda Aerospace and government-supported initiatives
use drones for precision spraying, reducing chemical usage and improving crop yield.

This use case is important in India due to the large agricultural workforce and the
growing need for efficient and sustainable farming practices.


Use Case: Logistics and Delivery Services
Drones are being explored in India for last-mile delivery of medicines, vaccines,
and essential supplies, especially in remote and hard-to-reach areas. They help
reduce delivery time and dependency on road infrastructure.


Use Case: Infrastructure Inspection
Drones are used for inspection of bridges, highways, power lines, pipelines,
and construction sites. They provide high-resolution aerial data without requiring
manual inspections in hazardous environments.


Use Case: Disaster Management and Emergency Services
Drones play a crucial role in disaster response by providing real-time aerial views
of affected areas. They assist in search and rescue operations, damage assessment,
and delivery of emergency supplies.
Example:
During floods and natural disasters in India, drones have been used to locate
stranded individuals and assess damage in inaccessible regions.

This use case helps authorities respond faster and improve coordination during
emergencies.


Use Case: Surveillance and Security
Drones are used by law enforcement and security agencies in India for crowd
monitoring, border surveillance, traffic management, and public safety operations.
They provide real-time monitoring with minimal manpower.
Example:
Police departments in multiple Indian cities use drones for surveillance during
public events and monitoring sensitive areas.


Use Case: Media, Entertainment, and Cinematography
Drones are widely used in the media and entertainment industry for aerial
cinematography, sports broadcasting, and film production. They enable creative
camera angles at lower costs compared to traditional methods.
