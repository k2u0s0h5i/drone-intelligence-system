DRONE REGISTRATION – DIGITAL SKY PLATFORM

All drones must be registered on the Digital Sky platform.

Registered drones are issued a Unique Identification Number (UIN).

Drones exempted under the Drone Rules 2021 are not required to obtain a UIN.

The Digital Sky platform acts as a single-window system for drone registration
and approvals.
