India’s drone industry has strong growth potential due to increasing adoption
across agriculture, logistics, infrastructure, surveillance, and public services.
Supportive government policies and simplified regulations have accelerated
industry growth.

The Government of India has introduced initiatives such as the Production Linked
Incentive (PLI) scheme to promote domestic drone manufacturing and reduce
dependency on imports. These initiatives aim to attract investments and boost
local innovation.

India has a growing ecosystem of drone startups and service providers working
on agricultural drones, defense applications, mapping, and delivery services.
Companies such as ideaForge and Garuda Aerospace play a key role in this ecosystem.

The drone services sector, including operations, data processing, and traffic
management, is expected to grow significantly and generate large-scale
employment opportunities.

Future trends include drone-based logistics, medical deliveries, drone taxis,
urban mapping, and integration with smart city initiatives, positioning India as a
potential global drone hub.
