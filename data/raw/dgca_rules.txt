Under the Drone Rules, 2021, drone operations in India are regulated by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) through the Digital Sky platform. Drones must be registered, except exempted nano drones. India’s airspace is divided into green, yellow, and red zones—no permission is required in green zones, ATC permission is required in yellow zones, and Central Government permission is required in red zones. A remote pilot license is not needed for nano drones and micro drones used for non-commercial purposes, but is required for other categories. Operators must follow safety rules, avoid flying over crowds or restricted areas, must not carry weapons or dangerous goods, report accidents within 48 hours.
