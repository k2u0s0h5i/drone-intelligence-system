Despite their advantages, drones face technical limitations such as limited battery
life, which restricts flight duration and operational range. This affects long-distance
and continuous operations.

Drone performance is highly dependent on weather conditions. Strong winds, rain,
and poor visibility can impact flight stability and data accuracy, limiting their use
in adverse conditions.

Privacy concerns are a major challenge associated with drone operations. Aerial
surveillance raises concerns about unauthorized data collection, requiring strict
regulatory enforcement and ethical usage.

Safety risks also exist, including mid-air collisions, technical failures, and misuse.
Improper handling or lack of training can lead to accidents, especially in populated
areas.

High initial costs, maintenance expenses, and the need for trained personnel act
as barriers to widespread adoption, particularly for small businesses and rural
operators.
