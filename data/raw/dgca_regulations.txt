DRONE RULES 2021 – INDIA (DGCA)

1. Introduction
• The Drone Rules 2021 were introduced by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to simplify
  drone regulations in India while ensuring safety and security.
• Drones are categorized as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and are regulated
  by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).
• The rules aim to promote innovation, ease of doing business, and responsible
  drone operations across the country.

2. Classification of Drones (Based on Weight)
• Nano drones: Weighing up to 250 grams.
• Micro drones: Weighing more than 250 grams and up to 2 kilograms.
• Small drones: Weighing more than 2 kilograms and up to 25 kilograms.
• Medium drones: Weighing more than 25 kilograms and up to 150 kilograms.
• Large drones: Weighing more than 150 kilograms.

3. Airspace Classification
• Indian airspace is divided into three zones for drone operations.
• Green Zone:
  – Drone operations are permitted up to 400 feet above ground level.
  – No prior permission is required to operate in this zone.
• Yellow Zone:
  – Restricted airspace where permission from the concerned Air Traffic Control
    authority is mandatory.
• Red Zone:
  – Designated no-drone zone.
  – Drone operations require permission from the Central Government.

4. Drone Registration
• All drones must be registered on the Digital Sky platform.
• Registered drones are issued a Unique Identification Number (UIN).
• Drones exempted under the Drone Rules 2021 are not required to obtain a UIN.
• The Digital Sky platform acts as a single-window system for registration and
  approvals.

5. Remote Pilot License
• A remote pilot license is required to operate most drones in India.
• Nano drones and non-commercial use of micro drones are exempt from this
  requirement.
• The license is issued through DGCA-authorized drone training organizations.
• Pilot certification and licensing are managed online via the Digital Sky platform.

6. Permissions and Compliance
• No permission is required for operating drones in green zones.
• Yellow zone operations require clearance from Air Traffic Control authorities.
• Operators must comply with height limits, airspace restrictions, and operational
  guidelines prescribed by DGCA.

7. Penalties and Enforcement
• The maximum penalty for violations under the Drone Rules 2021 is ₹1,00,000.
• The rules emphasize self-certification, digital monitoring, and minimal human
  intervention.
• Safety and security features such as geo-fencing and “No Permission – No Takeoff”
  (NPNT) are promoted to prevent misuse.

8. Government Initiatives and Support
• The Government of India supports drone adoption through initiatives such as the
  Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.
• The PLI scheme encourages domestic manufacturing and innovation in the drone
  sector.
• These initiatives aim to position India as a global drone hub in the coming years.
