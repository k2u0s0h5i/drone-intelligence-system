The demand for agriculture drones in India is increasing rapidly as farmers adopt modern technology to improve crop spraying, seeding, and crop monitoring. Agriculture drones help reduce labor dependency, minimize chemical wastage, and improve efficiency in farming operations.

In 2025, the price of agriculture drones in India depends mainly on tank capacity, automation features, and DGCA compliance. Entry-level agriculture drones with 10–16 liter capacity typically cost between ₹2.5 lakh and ₹4 lakh. Mid-range spraying drones with 20–30 liter capacity range from ₹4.5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh. Heavy-duty agriculture drones with capacities above 50 liters cost between ₹8 lakh and ₹12 lakh. Prices may vary based on warranty, spare parts availability, GPS systems, and after-sales support.

The Government of India supports drone adoption in agriculture through schemes such as the Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM). Small and marginal farmers can receive up to 50% subsidy with a maximum limit of ₹5 lakh. Farmer Producer Organizations, cooperatives, and startups can receive up to 75% subsidy for demonstration purposes. In some cases, Custom Hiring Centers receive full financial assistance to establish drone service hubs. Farmers apply for subsidies through their respective state agriculture department portals using Aadhaar, landholding documents, and bank details.

Agriculture drones provide significant advantages compared to manual spraying. Manual spraying usually covers about one acre per hour and requires multiple workers, while drone spraying can cover 8–10 acres per hour with a single trained operator. Drone spraying reduces chemical wastage, improves farmer safety by minimizing exposure to harmful chemicals, and lowers the overall cost per acre. Manual spraying costs around ₹400–₹600 per acre, whereas drone spraying costs approximately ₹150–₹200 per acre.

A farmer managing 50 acres of land can save approximately ₹15,000–₹20,000 per farming season by using a 20-liter agriculture drone instead of traditional manual spraying methods.

For example, a farmer from Punjab invested in a 20-liter agriculture spraying drone in 2024. Within one season, the farmer reduced spraying labor costs by nearly 65%, increased daily coverage from 2 acres to about 10 acres, and achieved a 12% improvement in crop yield due to uniform spraying.

Overall, agriculture drones are becoming an essential tool for modern farming in India. With affordable entry-level pricing, government subsidies, and proven economic benefits, agriculture drones represent a valuable investment for improving productivity and sustainability in Indian agriculture.
