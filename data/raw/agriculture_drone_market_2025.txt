AGRICULTURE DRONES IN INDIA – MARKET, COST, SUBSIDY AND BENEFITS

The demand for agriculture drones in India is increasing rapidly as farmers adopt modern technology to improve crop spraying, seeding, and crop monitoring. Agriculture drones help reduce labor dependency, minimize chemical wastage, improve spraying accuracy, and increase overall efficiency in farming operations. With rising labor costs and the need for precision agriculture, drones are becoming an essential tool for modern farming in India.

In 2025, the price of agriculture drones in India depends mainly on tank capacity, automation features, GPS systems, and DGCA compliance. Entry-level agriculture drones with 10–16 liter capacity typically cost between ₹2.5 lakh and ₹4 lakh. Mid-range spraying drones with 20–30 liter capacity range from ₹4.5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh. Heavy-duty agriculture drones with capacities above 50 liters cost between ₹8 lakh and ₹12 lakh. Prices may vary based on warranty, spare parts availability, software features, and after-sales support.

The Government of India actively supports the adoption of agriculture drones through subsidy schemes such as the Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM). Small and marginal farmers can receive subsidies of up to 50% with a maximum limit of ₹5 lakh. Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), cooperatives, and agri-startups are eligible for subsidies of up to 75% for demonstration purposes. In some cases, Custom Hiring Centers receive full financial assistance to establish drone-based spraying services. Farmers can apply for subsidies through their respective state agriculture department portals using Aadhaar, landholding documents, and bank details.

Agriculture drones offer significant advantages compared to traditional manual spraying methods. Manual spraying typically covers about one acre per hour and requires multiple workers, whereas drone spraying can cover 8–10 acres per hour with a single trained operator. Drone spraying reduces chemical wastage, improves farmer safety by minimizing exposure to harmful pesticides, and lowers operational costs. Manual spraying costs around ₹400–₹600 per acre, while drone spraying costs approximately ₹150–₹200 per acre.

From a return-on-investment perspective, a farmer managing around 50 acres of land can save approximately ₹15,000–₹20,000 per farming season by using a 20-liter agriculture drone instead of traditional manual spraying methods. In a practical example, a farmer from Punjab who invested in a 20-liter agriculture spraying drone in 2024 reduced spraying labor costs by nearly 65%, increased daily coverage from 2 acres to about 10 acres, and achieved a 12% improvement in crop yield due to uniform and timely spraying.

Overall, agriculture drones are transforming Indian agriculture by making farming more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable. With affordable entry-level pricing, strong government subsidy support, and proven economic benefits, agriculture drones represent a valuable long-term investment for Indian farmers.
