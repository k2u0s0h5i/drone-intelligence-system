AIRSPACE CLASSIFICATION FOR DRONES IN INDIA

 Indian airspace is classified into three zones for drone operations: Green Zone, Yellow Zone, and Red Zone. The Green Zone is an airspace where drone operations are permitted up to 400 feet above ground level and no prior permission is required from authorities to fly drones in this zone. The Yellow Zone is a restricted airspace where drone operations are allowed only after obtaining mandatory permission from the concerned Air Traffic Control (ATC) authority. The Red Zone is designated as a no-drone zone, and drone operations in this area are strictly prohibited unless special permission is obtained from the Central Government. This airspace classification system is managed through the Digital Sky platform to ensure safe and regulated drone operations across India.
